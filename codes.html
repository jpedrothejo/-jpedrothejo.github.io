   <h1>Sometimes, there are errors on the website, so I made error codes for them! Here are the error codes you can find:</h1>
   <p>1. Error Code 1 meaning the page either does not exist or has went down.</p>
   <p>2. Error Code 2 meaning the page has no content or is planned to being recycled, like <a href="test.asp">this</a> page.</p>
